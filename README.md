# Data Structures Repository

This repository contains implementations of various data structures covered in the **Data Structures** course taught by **Professor Gilberto Farias**. The implementations are written in **Python** and **C++**, providing a comparative perspective on how data structures are handled in different programming languages.

## About

This repository is designed as a study resource for students and developers who want to understand data structures and their applications in Python and C++. Each implementation includes:

- Clean and well-documented code
- Examples of usage
- Performance analysis when applicable

## Implemented Data Structures

The repository includes implementations of the following data structures:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **C++ (C++17)**

## Installation

### Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ralfferreira/data-structures.git
cd data-structures
```

### Run Python implementations:
```sh
python3 filename.py
```

### Compile and Run C++ implementations:
```sh
g++ -o output filename.cpp
./output
```

## Usage

Each data structure has a dedicated directory containing:
- Source files
- Example usage
- Performance comparisons (when applicable)

## Testing

Each data structure implementation comes with a test input file (e.g., `teste_input.txt`) that contains a sequence of operations to test all functionalities. To use these test files:

1. Compile the program as shown in the Installation section
2. Run the program
3. When the program starts, simply copy all the content from the test file and paste it into the program's input
4. The program will automatically process all test cases

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you wish to add a new data structure, optimize existing implementations, or improve documentation, feel free to submit a pull request.
